Welcome to my new digital home! 

Today, **December 24, 2025**, marks the official launch of my personal website. 

I designed this platform to serve as a central hub for my work in **Electrical Engineering** and **Robotics**. I built this site using **Hugo**, heavily customized to focus on readability and structure.

### What you will find here:
* **Project Showcases:** Deep dives into my work with ROS 2, UAVs, and perception systems.
* **Research Notes:** Snippets of code, math, and theory from my studies.
* **Dev Logs:** Updates on the tools and software I am building.

Stay tuned for more updates!
