## 💼 Research & Experience

### **Autonomous UAV-Based Crop Growth Mapping (Senior Year Project)** *May 2025 – Present* Leading a multimodal data campaign for wheat phenotyping to address food security.
* **Hardware:** Architected a 500mm carbon-fiber quadcopter (Pixhawk 6C, Odroid N2+, Livox Mid-360).
* **Autonomy:** Developed a real-time stack on Linux integrating **FAST-LIVO2** LiDAR odometry and **ArduPilot EKF3** fusion.
* **Mapping:** Generated high-fidelity 3D orthomosaics using Agisoft Metashape & Open3D for spatial-temporal analysis.

### **Visual-to-Motion Robotic Drawing** *Jan 2025 – April 2025* * Developed a vision-guided sketching system for an **Interbotix Widow X 250s** arm.
* Designed a pipeline: Image contour extraction → Trajectory generation → Real-time execution via **MoveIt**.
* Performed extrinsic calibration using RGB-D cameras (RealSense D455) and projective geometry.

### **Real-Time Age & Gender Prediction** *Jan 2025 – April 2025* * Built a dual-head **ResNet** deep learning system for simultaneous age regression and gender classification.
* Implemented **Bayesian inference** with Monte Carlo dropout to quantify predictive uncertainty.
* Deployed via **TensorFlow.js** for real-time in-browser inference.
